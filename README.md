# ML PROJECT USING AZURE_ML_STUDIO_-MLOPS-

# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End Project in Azure ML Studio

Welcome to my **end-to-end machine learning project** on **Customer Churn Prediction** built entirely using **Azure ML Studio**.  
This project demonstrates my **hands-on learning of MLOps workflows** – from **data ingestion** to **model deployment and monitoring** – using cloud-native tools and practices.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave a service)** based on their historical and behavioral data.  
More importantly, this project served as a **complete learning experience** on how to execute **MLOps pipelines using Azure ML Studio**.

## ✅ What I Learned

By completing this project, I gained practical experience in:

- 📂 **Data Ingestion** using Azure ML Datasets
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** with Jupyter and Azure Data Prep
- 🧠 **Model Building & Training** with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
- 📊 **Experiment Tracking** using MLflow within Azure
- 🗂️ **Model Registration** and versioning in Azure Model Registry
- 🚀 **Model Deployment** as a real-time endpoint using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- 📈 **Model Monitoring** using Application Insights for drift and performance
- 🔄 **ML Pipelines** for automating the entire ML lifecycle

## 💡 Why This Project?
This project helped me solidify my understanding of:

Real-world MLOps best practices

Azure ML Studio’s complete ecosystem

End-to-end machine learning project architecture in the cloud

How to take a model from notebook to production-grade deployment



## 🤖 Automated ML (AutoML) in Azure ML Studio
As part of this project, I leveraged Azure ML Studio’s Automated ML (AutoML) capabilities to streamline model development and selection.

What I Did with AutoML:
Selected classification as the problem type (for predicting churn vs. non-churn).

Uploaded and configured the dataset within the Azure ML Studio environment.

Used AutoML to automatically run multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

Compared model performance using accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and other metrics.

Selected the best-performing model and promoted it to production.

Registered the model and used it in downstream deployment and monitoring pipelines.

### Why AutoML?
Using Azure’s AutoML helped:

Save time by automating model training and evaluation

Ensure consistency and reproducibility

Understand trade-offs between various algorithms through detailed leaderboard and visualizations
